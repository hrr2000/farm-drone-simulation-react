Aerial imagery can save farmers a lot of time by giving them a bird's eye view of crops; that way, they can quickly get a
sense of vegetation's health, insect issues, irrigation layouts, and weed growth. It even allows them to precisely determine
how much pesticide the crops require.
Between flights, the drone typically lives inside a weatherproofed box, where it self-charges and processes all the
data it collects.
When the drone takes flight to examine fields, the box top opens and the fully autonomous drone lifts off, usingAI
to plot and conduct the run.
Drone missions can be scheduled or launched on-demand.
The drone inspects crop health and gathers crop stress data that farmers can use throughout a crop's life cycle. A
stress in crop production is an external factor that decreases crop yields (e.8, diseases, insects, salinity, etc.).
